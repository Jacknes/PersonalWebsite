    <h2>Technical</h2>
    <!--The technical aspects of your website: eg: describe the structure of your website, what CSS selectors/id's etc you used and why you used them.(about half a page)-->
    <img src="assets/WebsiteLayout.jpg" class="techPics" alt="A diagram of the website layout.">
    <p>Technically speaking my website is composed of four HTML pages, and a single CSS file. This means that changes that occur to the CSS file will apply to all pages, which keeps them all in line in terms of styling. </p>
    
    <p>The Navigation bar contains a heading 1 tag "Jack Pascoe" and the navigation bar (That uses a unorder list as its backbone).</p>
    
    <p>The content section of the pages primarily contains heading 2 tags, pre and p tags for the main text. Most pages also include images that describe what was talked about.</p>
    
    <p>The footer div contains simply a p tag for displaying student number, name and copyright.</p>
    
   <p>The site currently complies with HTML 4.01 and CSS 2.1 with a few CSS 3 specific items.</p>
    
    
    <p>The selecters and ID's I have implemented are the following:</p>
    
    <table class="selectTable">
        <tr>
            <th>Selector / ID</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td>.heading</td>
            <td>Used to define the colour, font and alignment.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td>.header</td>
            <td>Used to set the background colour, padding, position and size of the navigation bar.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td>.wrapper</td>
            <td>A div used to ensure the website takes up the entire page and leaves no gaps.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td>.active</td>
            <td>Sets the attributes of the nav button of the current page, changing it's colour.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td>.content</td>
            <td>The div that holds the main content of the page. The CSS defines the padding on each side to ensure all the content is visible irrelevant to screen size.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td>#home</td>
            <td>ID used to set the variables of the image of me on the home page.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td>#name</td>
            <td>Controls the style of the span used to bold my name on the home page.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td>.footer</td>
            <td>Class that sets the background colour, position, size, padding and overflow of the footer.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td>.selectTable</td>
            <td>Sets the size, element spacing, font and font size of the table.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td>#topName</td>
            <td>ID used to the large Jack Pascoe to the left of my navigation bar, sets the colour, position, font and padding.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td>.selectTable</td>
            <td>Sets the size, element spacing, font and font size of the table.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td>#sanFran &amp; #chem</td>
            <td>ID's that set the size, margin and location of the images</td>
        </tr>
         <tr> 
            <td>#chemFriend</td>
            <td>Sets the attributes for the span that is used as a caption of the chemFriend image.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td>.techPics</td>
            <td>Sets the attributes for displaying the technical pictures on the comments page.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <!--The aesthetics of your website - eg: how users should perceive your page and what effects you were trying to achieve (about half a page).-->
    
    <p>In terms of aesthetics I have chosen a simple blue colour palette (Navy, Dark blue and an Aqua). Apart from a sleek look, the colours are easily distinguishable making the website easy to read and navigate. </p>
    <img src="assets/NavBar.png" alt="Navigation bar diagram." class="techPics">
    <p>The hover and active attributes of the navigation bar are intended to clearly illustrate where the user currently is and where they are selecting to go next.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>The fonts used are intentionally minimalistic as to not take away from the content and are easy on the eye. The fonts used are <strong>Lato</strong> for headings and <strong>Helvetica Neue</strong> for all other text.</p>
    
    <p>Overall, the aesthetics of my website were specifically selected to create a sleek and minimalistic feel with spaced out easy to read content.</p>
    
    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <!--The accessibility aspects of your website - eg: how you made your web site usable by disabled users
    A quick guide to accessibilty can be found at http://w3schools.com/quality/quality_accessibility.asp and at http://webaim.org/intro/-->
    
    <p>The colour palette selected is intentionally easily distinguishable from one another using colours that do not conflict in the colour blind spectrum. </p>
    
    <p>All images have alt attributes attached to them that describe what the image depicts, so that screen readers can be used to help the vision impaired get a picture of the entire site.</p>
    
    <p>The sites variables are percentages, thus the website reacts and scales as the browser is resized to allow a larger number of users to view it.</p>
