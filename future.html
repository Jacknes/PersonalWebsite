    <p>I am extremely excited to finally be able to focus purely on Software and IT. Currently I am pursuing a career as a Software developer, most likely in Mobile or Desktop development. Companies such as <a href="https://www.vivant.com.au/" target="_blank">Vivant</a> and <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/b/" target="_blank">Campaign Monitor</a> are ideal, as they are reasonably small, are extremely agile and do not require a soul on entry.</p>
    
    <p>I plan to elect software development subjects where possible, however I understand that if  I want to succeed in the industry I will have to learn a whole lot more in my own time.</p>
    
    <p>I also would like to expand my current portfolio and programming language library, learning as many languages as I can (Being proficient in them obviously), ideally having a portfolio piece in all the languages I know. </p>
    
    <p>By the time I graduate in 2018, I would like to be fully equipped to develop in the field that I will pursue.</p>
    
    <p>Being a part of the BIT co-op program, I will be lucky enough to gain experience in two 6 month placements at two of the scholarship sponsor companies. I am extremely excited to be able to jump into real world development within my first year of Uni!</p>

    <p> Ideally, after Two years in my first Grad job, I will look to move to the US. I would love to find a development job at a start up in LA, San Francisco or New York, however getting my foot in the door over there at a good company would still be unreal. This timeline is optimistic I think, but crazier things have happened. </p>
